**Affordable Housing**: Housing units that are affordable by that section of society whose income is below the median household income.

**Berlin Housing Market**: The market comprising the supply and demand for residential properties in Berlin, including rental and ownership options.

**Gentrification**: The process of renovating and improving a house or district so that it conforms to middle-class taste, often resulting in displacement of lower-income families.

**Rent Control**: Government-imposed limits on the amount landlords can charge for renting out a home or apartment.

**Social Housing**: Housing provided by the government or non-profit organizations at reduced rents for people with low incomes.

**Housing Affordability Index (HAI)**: A measure used to determine whether a typical family can qualify for a mortgage loan on a typical home.

**Mietspiegel** — The official Berlin rent index, published every two years.  
It provides standardized information on average rents by location, building age, and apartment size, and is used as the legal reference for determining fair rents in Berlin.

**Median Household Income**: The income amount that divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half below.

**Vacancy Rate**: The percentage of all available units in a rental property that are vacant or unoccupied at a particular time.

**Subsidized Housing**: Housing that is financially supported by the government to make it affordable to low-income residents.

**Urban Density**: The number of people living in a unit of urban area, often used to measure how crowded a city or neighborhood is.

**Mietspiegel Class**: A classification used in the Berlin rent index to categorize apartments based on features such as location, age, and quality, which influences the rent level.

**Rent-to-Income Ratio**: The proportion of a household’s income that is spent on rent, used to assess housing affordability.

**Point of Interest (POI) Density**: A measure of the number of amenities and services, such as shops, schools, and parks, within a specific area, indicating neighborhood accessibility.

**Subdistrict (Ortsteil)**: A smaller administrative division within a Berlin district, often representing distinct neighborhoods with unique characteristics.

**District (Bezirk)**: One of the twelve main administrative areas of Berlin, each comprising several subdistricts and responsible for local governance.

**Affordability Category**: A classification that indicates the relative affordability of housing units based on rent levels and household income thresholds.


**Median Rent per m²**: The middle value of rent prices per square meter in a given area, meaning half of the rents are higher and half are lower. It is commonly used to describe typical rental costs, minimizing the impact of outliers.

**Cold Rent (Kaltmiete)**: The base rent paid for a dwelling, not including additional costs such as heating, water, and maintenance fees. In Germany, this is the rent amount agreed upon for the use of the property alone.

**Warm Rent (Warmmiete)**: The total rent including the cold rent plus additional costs (Nebenkosten), such as heating, water, and sometimes other utilities. This represents the full monthly payment required from the tenant.

**Population Share (Youth/Senior)**: The proportion of the total population in a specific area that falls within a defined age group, such as youth (e.g., under 18) or seniors (e.g., over 65). Used to describe demographic structure.

**Median Income (Subdistrict vs. District)**: The comparison of the median income at the subdistrict (Ortsteil) level with that of the overall district (Bezirk), highlighting local income disparities within the city.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data by transforming correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components, capturing most of the variance in the data.

**KMeans Clustering**: An unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into a predefined number of clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. Used for pattern recognition and segmentation.

**DBSCAN**: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise; an unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed and marks points in low-density regions as outliers. Useful for discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes.

**Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for modeling the probability of a binary outcome (such as yes/no or true/false) based on one or more predictor variables. Commonly used for classification tasks.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The process of analyzing datasets using visualizations and summary statistics to understand patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions before modeling.

**Data Cleaning**: The process of preparing raw data by handling missing values, correcting errors, normalizing formats (e.g., ü → ue for joins), and removing duplicates to ensure consistency and accuracy.

**Rule-Based Classification**: A simple method of categorization where rules (such as rent-to-income thresholds) determine the outcome, rather than predictive machine learning.

**Silhouette Score**: A metric used to evaluate clustering quality. It measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters (ranges from -1 to 1, with higher being better).

**Cluster Profile**: A descriptive summary of a cluster that characterizes it using average values of key variables (e.g., income, rent, population, POIs). Used for interpreting and naming clusters.

**Story Dashboard (Tableau)**: A sequence of interactive Tableau dashboards arranged as a guided narrative. In this project, it provides an overview of Berlin housing trends.

**Mobile Dashboard (Tableau)**: A version of a Tableau dashboard optimized for smaller screens. This project includes separate mobile dashboards for census, districts, patterns, and population.

**Explain This Assistant**: The built-in Q&A helper in the app that responds to user questions by searching project documentation (`docs/faq.md`, `docs/glossary.md`, etc.).
